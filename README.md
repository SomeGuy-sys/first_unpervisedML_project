# first_unpervisedML_project
This was the first project that I had while taking an unsupervised machine learning class in 2020.

Using the MINST handwrittern numberset data. written in python and using python notebooks, I was able to classify hand writtern digits by using a k-means algorithm and also implemented another classification algorthim to compare performance with eachother.

# What I learned
- Using python libaries like ***TensorFlow*** and numpy
- Applying machine learning on a given dataset
